    <p>Holi is a very famous and colorful festival of India, celebrated every year with great enthusiasm.

      (gulal) on each other, share happiness, and even embrace their enemies to spread the message of friendship.
       Holi symbolizes change, new beginnings, and the victory of good over evil.</p>
       <p>The tradition of celebrating Holi has been followed since ancient India, connected with many stories from Hindu religion.
         The most important story is about Holika Dahan, in which Prahlad, a great devotee of Lord Vishnu, was saved by his devotion and 
         truthfulness from the cruelty of his father, the demon king Hiranyakashipu.
          Holika, the sister of Hiranyakashipu, had sacrificed herself by sitting in the fire to kill Prahlad, but due to Prahlad's 
          devotion, he was saved and Holika burned to death. This story gives the message that good always triumphs over evil.</p>
          <p>Holi is celebrated on the full moon night of the month of Phalguna (usually in February or March). 
            The festival starts on this day, and the next day people apply colors on each other and celebrate together. 
            On the day before Holi, Holika Dahan is performed, where people light a big fire to destroy evil, symbolizing the story of Holika and Prahlad.</p>
            <p>During this festival, people share sweets, play, sing, and dance to celebrate their happiness. 
              Holi has a special significance in Bihar and all over India, where it is celebrated with great joy and enthusiasm.

    <p>Eid-ul-Fitr is one of the most important and sacred festivals of Islam. 
      It is celebrated on the first day of the Islamic month of Shawwal, immediately after the month-long fasting of Ramadan—usually falling in April or May.

This festival marks the end of fasting and is a celebration of joy, gratitude, and spiritual accomplishment. 
During Ramadan, Muslims practice fasting, prayer, and good deeds. Eid is the festive reward for their devotion.

On this day, people take a bath, wear clean clothes, offer the special Eid prayer, and greet each other with “Eid Mubarak.
” Sweet dishes like "Sevaiyan" (vermicelli pudding) are prepared, which is why it is also called "Sweet Eid."

Before Eid, Muslims give a mandatory charity called “Fitrana” so that the less fortunate can also celebrate the festival. Eid-ul-Fitr spreads the message of brotherhood, compassion, equality, and peace.

    <p>Muharram is the first month of the Islamic calendar and one of the holiest months for Muslims. 
      It is especially significant for Shia Muslims, as it marks the martyrdom of Imam Hussain, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, on the 10th day of Muharram, known as Ashura.

Imam Hussain was killed in the Battle of Karbala for standing against injustice and tyranny. Muharram symbolizes the struggle for truth, justice, and sacrifice.

Shia Muslims mourn during this month by wearing black clothes, performing processions (Tazia), and remembering the tragedy of Karbala. 
Some express grief through self-flagellation, symbolizing the pain Imam Hussain went through.

Sunni Muslims also consider the month sacred and observe fasting, especially on the 9th and 10th of Muharram, but they do not mourn in the same way.

Muharram teaches us to stand up for truth and righteousness, even in the face of great adversity.
